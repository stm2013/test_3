            <p> The scanning tunneling microscope was invented by Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer in 1981 in IBM, for
                which they received the Nobel Prize in physics for in 1986. The tool is a powerful microscopic technique
                capable of
                achieving sub-nanometer resolution of surfaces and is today routinely used by scientists to visualize
                and image surface topographies based on the local density of states concept <a href="references.html">[1]</a>.
                By using a probe with an atomically sharp tip and an applied bias, a highly sensitive tunneling current
                can be conducted into the sample. Consequently, scanning the surface and measuring the changes in
                tunneling current results in an image representing the surfaces electronic environment <a
                        href="references.html">[2]</a>. This enables researchers to obtain a better
                understanding about their subject on a molecular level. One advantage over other characterization
                methods is its great
                versatility as it can
                operate in air, vacuum and liquids under non ambient conditions.

            <p> However, one major disadvantage is the use of highly specialized equipment that is fragile and
                expensive. The
                commercial prices of quality microscopes can range from $30 000 to $150 000
                and are
                thus inaccessible to nonprofessional users such as scientists in development countries. Via the
                introduction
                of cheap tunnelling microscopes, the market would be extended to applicants with limited budgets such as
                scientific
                communities in development countries, undergraduate students in engineering and science educations as
                well as
                hobbyists. This project thus revolves around the design and implementation of an open source low cost
                scanning
                tunnelling microscope built from standard components, designing a standard operating procedure and if
                time
                permits
                develop a business concept for the product. Stakeholders include engineering and scientific communities
                in
                development
                countries, scientific education and research institutes as well as nano enthusiasts.</p>
